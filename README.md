## üîß Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one for free from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### 2. Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/diy-ai-fix-it.git
    cd diy-ai-fix-it
    ```

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    The application is configured to use an environment variable `process.env.API_KEY` for the Gemini API key. You will need to make this variable available to your local development environment. How you do this depends on your setup. For simple local testing, you can temporarily hardcode it in `services/geminiService.ts`, but **do not commit this to version control.**

3.  **Run the application:**
    Since this project uses ES modules and a static `index.html`, you can run it with any simple local web server. One of the easiest ways is using the `serve` package.
    ```bash
    # Install serve globally if you don't have it
    npm install -g serve

    # Run the server from the project's root directory
    serve .
    ```
    The server will give you a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) to open in your browser.
